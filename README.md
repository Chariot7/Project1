##Rider Waite Tarot Spread

The Tarot Cards were used as a divination tool. The main deck that is used today was created by wizards in a Magickal order call the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. 

This game is using the Rider Waite deck and many of the descriptions are from A.E. Waite whom the deck is named after.
